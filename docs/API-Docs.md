The APIs OctMatrix package exposed to users are provided by a class called  `OctMatrix`. They are high-level matrix operators and operations APIs. The full API list is in this [document](resources/OctMatrix-manual.pdf). If you use the [RStuido IDE](R-IDEs.html), you can also view the API Dos in html style as showed in the picture below.

Besides the `OctMatrix` APIs, we also provide a bunch of scalable machine learning algorithms built on top of `OctMatrix`. Currently, the library contains logistic regression, linear Support Vector Machines(SVMs), linear regression, KMeans, softmax, deep nerual network(auto encoder), and support for many other Machine Learning algorithms is coming. Users can directly build their applications using these algorithms. The usage and description of these algorithms [here](ML-Library.html)
